* Heroku:
  (Have a free Dyno already, running the alpha-blog app. 

   Options are:
     * DELETE the previous app on Heroku to run this one, & 
       forego having multiple apps publically visible.
     * Pay a lot to host multiple RoR apps.
     * Combine features of the various coursework apps into a single app.

* RoR Free or inexpensive hosting:

  Heroku:     ONE free Dyno (1 app).
              "Hobby" tier is $84 per year **PER** app ($7/mo.)
  HostGator:  Shared, ONE domain, $4/mo first year, $10/mo thereafter.
  A2Hosting:  UNLIMITED domains, $5/mo first year, $12/mo thereafter.
  FastComet:  Already hosting swsuds.net here, so comparing. 
              Coud VPS required for RoR, $39/mo first year, $60/mo thereafter.

  RoR is resouce hungry, so most hosts recomend decicated VPS hosting, and that is expensive.
